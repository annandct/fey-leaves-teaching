# Join the Family Cookout!
We offer a subscription service for those who want to learn and have fun. Every month we send you three elements to join our ritual. 
## A story...
 ...a shared history and piece of culture from somewhere in the Black Diaspora.
## A recipie..
 ...simple and easy to follow along with, you hunt out the ingredients, you'll likely have to visit your Jamaican neighbor, or at least the corner bodega or nearby market for on the hunt. 
## A blessed ingredient. 
 ..Food is ritual.  We will send you a package of Féy leaves, or jon-jon (Haitian mushroom powder) and TRUST, it will have been blessed under a full moon by a ritual believer. The internet can deliver magic too - it just takes the post office a little time to get that magic from us to you.
