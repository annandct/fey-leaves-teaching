## [New Years Eve - Haitian Traditions](https://time.com/7203575/new-years-eve-haiti-traditions/)

I had an article published in the New York Times, a culmination and inception that made me want to move forward with this project. 

See the article linked above, but read below for everything ELSE that couldn't fit into a simply story. The history of BOUKMAN, THE BLACK PIG, THE SIGNS OF CHANGE. 

Listen... see.. or you will miss seeing and hearing in YOUR life. The spirit of revolution never rests long.
