> ## The tradition in Guadeloupe, when we open a new bottle of rum... 

It's October, and Guadeloupe is warm and windy like a Carolina summer at home. In the heat everything feels casual - no one is tight, no one is wasting energy holding themselves wound up as a clockwork machine. But make no mistake, the men of the community in this backyard are enacting ritual, tradition, embodied in the gestures and repeated moments - everpresent as the heat and breeze and sun.  

My scholarly voice wants to call out *Léwoz*, as we mix between Creole, French and English. He explains carefully... the moment of pouring libations for ancestors. The practice honors the strength of enslaved ancestors, remembers them and food and drink is elevated from substance to bridge a gap between generations and the spiritual world.

It's a lesson I've learned before, many of us have, and if I hadn't *already* known of it, I'm not sure I'd have been granted the explanation - much less in English. But this moment of teaching reaches beyond me and those around the social table. We acknowlege that reteaching the lesson, speaking about **why** it's done is as necessary as the ritual itself. We are remembering histories, painful times when there was little celebration to be had - when rum wasn't a drink of celebration but a cause of suffering and slavery to greedy production. 

I thank these men who remember with each drink and pour... those who have come before. Those fathers that taught, the uncles who spoke words of rememberence, and the sons who listened in - hoping to get some of that sweet rum that the ancestors were partaking in!

### Notes:
- In Guadeloupe’s *Léwoz* ceremonies, a tradition deeply tied to African heritage, libations are poured to venerate the resilience of enslaved ancestors and reconnect communities with their colonial-era resistance. 
- Libation practices have evolved from pre-colonial ceremonies into modern acts of cultural reclamation against historical wrongs.
